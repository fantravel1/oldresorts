## 🌍 Overview

**OldResorts.com** is a cult travel platform dedicated to resorts that time forgot — and somehow survived.

These places are:
- outdated  
- slightly broken  
- weirdly quiet  
- stuck in another decade  
- absolutely not trying to impress you  

And that’s exactly why they’re great.

OldResorts is **anti-Instagram travel**.
It celebrates places that gave up — and became honest.

## 🎯 Core Reframe: “Shitty” Means Unbothered

OldResorts does not apologize.

“Shitty” here means:
- unrenovated  
- uncurated  
- unbothered  
- unashamed  

No Edison bulbs.
No subway tile.
No gray paint.
No “experience design.”

Just:
> **What was left behind.**

---

## 🕰️ Core Concept: Time Capsules by Accident

OldResorts is about **accidental preservation**.

Selling points include:
- original carpets  
- wood paneling  
- pastel bathrooms  
- cigarette burn marks  
- hand-written signs  
- analog phones  
- lobby smells like 1987  

These are features.
Not flaws.

---

## ❓ The Only Question That Matters

Every listing answers one thing:

> **Why is this place still kind of amazing?**

Examples:
- “The pool is huge and empty.”  
- “Nobody cares if you’re loud.”  
- “The bar opens at 10am.”  
- “You can smoke on the balcony.”  
- “The view is insane.”  
- “The staff has been here 30 years.”  
- “It’s $59 and nobody judges you.”  

This format is addictive.

## 🗂️ Categories That Slap

OldResorts does not use normal filters.

Instead:

- Frozen in the ’70s  
- Former Luxury, Current Chaos  
- Divorce Dad Resorts  
- Retiree Strongholds  
- Once Hosted Celebrities  
- Still Has a Piano Bar  
- Motel Disguised as a Resort  
- Suspiciously Empty  
- Everything Is Brown  
- Pool > Everything Else  

These categories *are* the brand.

---

## 🎯 Who This Is For (Radical Honesty)

OldResorts is for:
- people who hate modern hotels  
- people who want space, not vibes  
- artists and writers  
- broke travelers with taste  
- weird romantics  
- introverts  
- people who miss smoking sections  

If you want:
- “luxury”
- “design”
- “Instagrammable”
- “aspirational”

This site is not for you.

## 🏊 Weird Amenities = Gold

Old resorts have incredible leftovers.

OldResorts celebrates:
- shuffleboard courts  
- tiki bars with one bartender  
- arcades with broken machines  
- sunken living rooms  
- giant bathtubs  
- unused conference rooms  
- indoor plants that survived decades  

Nothing ironic.
Everything sincere.

## 📊 The Old Resort Index™ (Signature Feature)

Each resort is scored on:

- **Time Warp** (1–10)  
- **Vibe Density**  
- **How Empty It Feels**  
- **Carpet Energy**  
- **Pool Quality**  
- **Bar Vibes**  
- **Zero Expectations Factor**  

This makes the site feel culty *and* serious.

## 📸 Brutally Honest Photos Only

Hard rules:
- no HDR  
- no wide-angle lies  
- no filters  
- no influencer poses  

Only:
- real rooms

This aesthetic *wins* on social.

## 📜 The “Do Not Renovate” Manifesto

A legendary page.

Key beliefs:
- Once you add Edison bulbs, it’s over.
- Subway tile kills souls.
- Gray paint is cultural erasure.
- Boutique conversions are funerals.

OldResorts openly mourns:
- renovations  
- “refreshes”  
- rebrands  
- design consultants  

This is preservation through appreciation.

---

## 🫶 Old Resorts as Emotional Refuge

Here’s the deeper truth.

Old resorts are:
- low pressure  
- anonymous  
- forgiving  
- emotionally quiet  
- non-aspirational  

People go there to:
- hide  
- reset  
- grieve  
- write  
- recover  
- disappear a little  

OldResorts honors that.

---

## 🧾 Legendary One-Liners (Required)

Every listing gets a headline:

- “Nobody will bother you here.”  
- “This place gave up and we love it.”  
- “The pool is better than the rooms.”  
- “Everything smells like sunscreen.”  
- “The bar knows your order by day two.”  
- “It’s not cool. That’s the point.”  

---

## 👕 Merch That Will Go Viral

This brand *demands* merch:

- **DO NOT RENOVATE** tees  
- **FORMERLY LUXURY** hats  
- **OLD POOLS > NEW HOTELS**  
- **TIME CAPSULE STAY**  

Low effort. High cult value.

---

## 💰 Monetization (Without Killing the Joke)

OldResorts never feels salesy.

Clean revenue:
- affiliate bookings  
- curated road trips  
- “last of its kind” lists  
- email drops (“3 dying resorts you should visit”)  

Scarcity is real.
These places won’t last forever.
